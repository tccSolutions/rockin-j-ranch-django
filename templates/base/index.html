        <p>"Horses don't think the same as humans. Something that's most unique about the horse, that I love, is not what he posses
            but what he doesn't posses. And that is greed, spite, hate, jealousy, envy, prejudice. The horse doesn't posses any of those things.
            If you think about people, the least desirable people to be around usualy possess some or all of those things. And the way God made the horse,
            he left that out."

            <h3>About The Ranch</h3>       
            <h6>
                Rocking-J-Ranch was founded over 20 years ago with the mindset of rehibillitating and rehoming wild mustangs.
                The owern's, David and Karen Jones, have been animal lovers from their first breath. Together they saw a need
                for wild mustangs to be homed. They realized that before these great animals can be homed they would need to
                be genteled. Thus, Rocking-J-Ranch was created. Since its founding, the ranch has trained and re-homed numerous 
                mustangs. Please visit the barn if you are interested in finding out more about the mustangs on the property.

            <h3>Training Techniques</h3>
            <h6>
                It has been proven time and time again that the old way of "breaking" horses is broken. At the Rockin-J-Ranch,
                the first priority is always the animals health and safety. We use the same techniques as many other world-famous 
                trainers, such as Clinton Anderson and Ray Hunt. These techniques focus heavily on ground-work and developing a mutual respect
                between horse, trainer, and rider.
